    "\n",
    "1. **Store the current crosstrack error, heading error, and downtrack position**. We want to keep track of the trajectory of the aircraft during our simulation so that we can plot it and analyze it after. To do this, we have defined three arrays for you: `cte_history`, `he_history`, and `dtp_history`. To start each loop iteration, you should store the values of these variables at the next slot in the array.\n",
    "2. **Decide if we should update our control**. Most real-world systems operate at a specific frequency, meaning that they only update their control every so often. For our simulation, we will only update our control (steering angle) on certain iterations of the loop controlled by the `ctrl_every` input. The default for this input is 20, so we only want to update our control at iteration 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, etc. What condition can we use to determine this? HINT: check out (python's modulo operator)[https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/the-python-modulo-operator-what-does-the-symbol-mean-in-python-solved/]. Can you come up with a condition using this operator that would only be true when i is a multiple of `ctrl_every`?\n",
    "3. **If we should update our control, update it**. To do this, we need to get the cte and he using the `getState` function and then input those into the `getControl` function to get a new value for `phiDeg`.\n",
    "4. **Get the next state based on the dynamics**. Call your dynamics function with the appropriate inputs.\n",
    "5. **Tell the simulator to move to that state**. You can use the function `setHomeState(client, cte, dtp, he)`"
