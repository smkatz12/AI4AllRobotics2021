    "In this notebook, we will introduce you to [X-Plane 11](https://www.x-plane.com/). X-Plane 11 is a flight simulator that can simulate all sorts different aircraft, scenery, takeoffs, landings, and many more aspects of flight. You will be using X-Plane 11 for your project to simulate an aircraft taxiing down a runway, so let's get familiar with it!"

    "First, let's just play around a bit with X-Plane 11 to check out some of its features. To do this, follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Open X-Plane 11.** Look for the X-Plane 11 icon in the dock at the bottom of your screen (it should be towards the right). Click this icon and X-Plane 11 will open. A window may pop up saying that there is an update available. If this happens, you can just click \"ignore\".\n",
    "2. **Click the \"Flight School\" button.** This should bring up a window with different tutorials. Feel free to try out any of them. I recommend starting with the X-Plane basics tutorial, but feel free to give any of them a try!\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're anything like me, you may have crashed a few times :). If so, not to worry! This is one of the reasons that simulators are so wonderful. They allow us to work out any bugs or issues before trying everything out on the real thing! "

    "## Connecting to X-Plane 11 using Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Most people use X-Plane 11 in the way you just did (controlling the aircraft with your mouse and keyboard sort of like playing a video game). However, for your project, we want to make the aircraft taxi down the runway on its own without us having to intervene. To do this, we will sort of \"hack\" X-Plane 11 to be controlled using python. NASA has written a nice plugin for us to do this called X-Plane Connect. Let's give it a try!\n",
    "\n",
    "1. From the main menu of X-Plane 11, click \"New Flight\". This should bring up a window with some flight configuration options.\n",
    "2. In the AIRCRAFT section, select the Cessna Skyhawk.\n",
    "3. In the location section, select Grant Co Intl (ID is KMWH).\n",
    "4. You can leave the weather as clear.\n",
    "5. In the TIME OF DAY section, select a time between 8AM and 10AM local.\n",
    "6. Click the \"Start Flight\" button at the bottom right of the screen. It make take a minute or so to load the flight. Once it loads, you should see the front of the aircraft pointing down a runway. We are now ready to start controlling it!\n"
